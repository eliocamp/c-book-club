# Exercises

The exercises from selected chapters of [C Programming: A Modern Approach (CPAMA)](http://knking.com/books/c2/) by K. N. King are shared here corresponding to each session of the Book Club. The chapters have been matched based on topics covered and are untested - there is no guarantee that the Book Club readings will provide the required background! So if an exercise seems too hard or irrelevant, feel free to skip it.

The exercises may refer to programs in CPAMA, you can get the corresponding code from the [Programs](http://knking.com/books/c2/programs/index.html) page of the CPAMA website.

There are [official solutions](http://knking.com/books/c2/answers/index.html) available for selected exercises and programming projects.

**We suggest you attempt (some of) the exercises marked with a ![W](W.jpg) icon in the selected CPAMA chapters, for which official solutions are available. But feel free to attempt more!**

These exercises are shared under fair use; to keep within this limitation the beginning and/or end of the Exercises section may be excluded and Programming Projects are only included if they fall on the same page or there are not so many exercises on the session topic(s). However, all exercises with a **![W](W.jpg)** icon should be complete.
